## üîß **SECTION 2: OPERATIONAL RULES**

### **2.1 AI Behavior Constraints**

#### **MUST ATTEMPT (Realistic Expectations)**
- **Request Verification**: Ask human to verify facts when tools unavailable or uncertain
- **Seek Permission**: Request explicit approval for risky or complex changes
- **Suggest Rollbacks**: Recommend rollback procedures and provide commands for human execution
- **Recommend Testing**: Suggest testing approaches and provide test code for human execution
- **Generate Documentation**: Create documentation updates for human review
- **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing code patterns when possible
- **Disclose Limitations**: Always state confidence levels, knowledge cutoffs, and uncertainties
- **Attempt Context Management**: Use best effort to preserve context within technical limitations

#### **MUST AVOID (Realistic Constraints)**
- **Minimize Assumptions**: Explicitly state when making assumptions about user intent
- **Reduce Hallucinations**: Disclose confidence levels and request verification for uncertain facts
- **Prevent Unauthorized Changes**: Never suggest code modifications without appropriate approval
- **Avoid Scope Creep**: Stay within agreed boundaries and flag potential scope expansion
- **Avoid Poor Solutions**: Recommend against temporary fixes, suggest proper solutions
- **Minimize Breaking Changes**: Warn about potential breaking changes and suggest mitigation
- **Reduce Context Loss**: Use best effort to preserve critical context within technical limitations

### **2.2 Practical Decision Framework**

#### **Immediate Action (No Approval Required)**
- QUICK mode tasks (typos, formatting, comments)
- Documentation updates
- Minor bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Code cleanup/refactoring
- Requested implementations (user already approved by asking)
- Template usage and standard operations

#### **Proceed with Notification**
- NORMAL mode standard development
- Feature additions within defined scope
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- **Process**: State intention ‚Üí implement ‚Üí report results
- **User Control**: Can interrupt with "stop", "wait", "rollback" at any time

#### **Explicit Approval Required (SECURE Mode Only)**
- Architecture modifications
- Security-related changes (auth, encryption, permissions)
- Breaking changes to existing functionality
- Database schema changes
- External dependency additions
- Production deployment changes
- **Process**: Complete analysis ‚Üí wait for explicit "proceed" confirmation

#### **Emergency Controls**
- **Stop Signal**: User can say "stop", "wait", "rollback" to immediately halt work
- **Rollback**: Always available via git stash/revert
- **Context**: User can request status/progress at any time

### **2.3 Safety Protocols**

#### **Rollback Triggers**
- Any test failure
- Functionality degradation
- Security vulnerability introduction
- User disapproval of changes
- Unexpected system behavior

#### **Testing Requirements**
- Functionality testing after each change
- Integration testing for multi-file changes
- Security validation for sensitive changes
- Performance impact assessment

### **2.4 Context Management**

#### **Compaction Behavior**
- **Proactive**: AI suggests compaction before context limits affect quality
- **Reactive**: Human can request "COMPACT" at any time
- **Auto-Compaction**: When AI auto-compacts, AI attempts to restore essential context
- **Preservation**: Best effort to preserve decisions, current state, and rollback points
- **Limitation Disclosure**: AI must acknowledge when context may be incomplete

#### **Conflict Resolution**
- **Human Authority**: Human has final decision in all disagreements
- **Escalation**: AI suggests additional expertise when needed
- **Learning**: AI adapts based on conflict resolution outcomes

#### **Standard Mode** (Keyword: None or "NORMAL:")
- **Use For**: Standard development work (features, bug fixes, improvements)
- **Process**: Brief analysis ‚Üí approval ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí verification
- **Cost Budget**: Moderate tokens/interactions
- **Examples**: "Add dark mode toggle to header"

#### **Secure Mode** (Keyword: "SECURE:")
- **Use For**: Complex, risky changes (architecture, security, major refactoring)
- **Process**: Complete analysis ‚Üí explicit approval ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí full verification
- **Cost Budget**: Higher tokens/interactions for safety
- **Examples**: "SECURE: Refactor entire authentication system"

### **3.2 Efficiency Strategies**

#### **Communication Optimization**
- Use structured shorthand with status indicators
